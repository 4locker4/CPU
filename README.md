# SPU

Hello! I present You my project called SPU. This is virtual realisation of CPU. It reads and execute assmebler code. 

SPU includes the Stack. Its implementation was previously presented in my git repository called Stack. 

### How it works?

First of all *SPU* reads Your assembler code from txt file. Than its convert code from adssembler into .bin file. Secondly, *Assembler* reads this bin file, translate it and execute.
